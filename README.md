In this program I will be creating a module that conatins a data class that stores data and meta data on greenhouse gases with built in methods
that carry out operations on the data and visualise that data. Sci-kitlearn is used. I will also create a notebook that gives a tutorial on how to use my code, it's called jupiter_help.
